# my-portfolio

## what was the goal of this project?

 - The goal of this project was to create a portfolio website of ourselves from scratch that meets the project criteria and is also responsive. I achieved this by dividing up the webpage into parts using semantic tags like`<header>, <footer>,`etc... There's a`<nav>`bar at the top of the webpage that has 3 different parts which when clicked direct you to that part of the webpage. Why have 1`<nav>`bar when you can have 2? The other one is at the bottom of the webpage and features various different contact links. There's also an "About Me" section that has an image of me and a short paragraph about my life. Lastly, you can't have a portfolio without featuring your work... So in this section I have linked images that when clicked, bring you to some of the projects that ive done/am working on.
